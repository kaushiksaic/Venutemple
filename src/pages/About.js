          <strong>Jaya Jaya Sri Sudarsana!</strong>

<p>Sri Venugopala Swamy temple is around 120 years old and is probably the oldest temple in Bolaram. The presiding deity here is Sri Rukmini Satyabhama Godhadevi sametha Sri Venugopala Swamy. Also, the presiding deity is Chaturbhuja Venugopala Swamy (Lord Krishna with 4 hands, flute and a cow) which is very unique and exclusive to the Sri Vaishnava Pancharatra tradition. The daily, fortnightly, monthly and annual rituals are being performed in maximum accordance to the Shastras and with the active participation of devotees for several decades now.</p>
